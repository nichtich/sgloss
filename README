sgloss is the little sister of authority file and encyclopedia

This project consists of:

 - an XML based format for simple glossaries

 - a couple of scripts to convert from and to sgloss format

 - a wiki software to edit glossaries online

You will find more information in the file 'about.xml' which
is also an example of an sgloss glossary.


GETTING STARTED

1. Put the project files into a web server that supports PHP.

2. Make sure that the directory 'data' is writeable by the
   user which your PHP scripts are run by. For instance:

   $  sudo chown www-data data 

3. Locate your browser to the web directory where you have
   installed the project files.

4. Make sure that the data directory is not readable via web

   http://example.org/data/
