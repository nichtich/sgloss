sgloss is the little sister of authority file and encyclopedia

This project consists of:

 - an XML based format for simple glossaries

 - a couple of scripts to convert from and to sgloss format

 - a wiki software to edit glossaries online

You will find more information in the file 'about.xml' which
is also an example of an sgloss glossary.
